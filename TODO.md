- [ ] **Transfer resume functionality** - Support for resuming interrupted file transfers
- [ ] **Data connection health monitoring** - Monitor data connection status during transfers

### Protocol Enhancements
- [ ] **Full FTP LIST format parsing** - Parse standard Unix-style directory listings (-rwxr-xr-x format)
- [ ] **Support for different directory listing formats** - Handle Windows-style and other FTP server listing formats
- [ ] **RETR command implementation** - Add file download functionality with progress tracking
- [ ] **Binary/ASCII transfer mode support** - Implement TYPE command for transfer mode selection

### User Interface Improvements
- [ ] **Enhanced directory listing display** - Format directory listings with proper columns, file sizes, and modification dates
- [ ] **Command history support** - Allow users to navigate through previous commands
- [ ] **Tab completion for commands** - Auto-complete FTP commands and local file names
- [ ] **Colored output support** - Use colors to distinguish different types of output

## Medium Priority Features

### Configuration & Usability
- [ ] **Batch script execution** - Support for executing multiple FTP commands from a script file
- [ ] **Configuration file management** - Allow runtime configuration changes without restarting
- [ ] **Multiple server profiles** - Support for saving and switching between different server configurations
- [ ] **Command aliases** - Allow users to create custom command shortcuts

### Security & Reliability
- [ ] **TLS/SSL support (FTPS)** - Add secure FTP connections
- [ ] **Connection pooling** - Reuse connections efficiently for multiple operations
- [ ] **Automatic reconnection** - Handle connection drops gracefully with automatic retry
- [ ] **Data integrity checks** - Verify file transfers with checksums

### Performance
- [ ] **Parallel transfers** - Support for concurrent file transfers
- [ ] **Bandwidth throttling** - Limit transfer speeds to prevent network congestion
- [ ] **Transfer statistics** - Detailed statistics for completed transfers
- [ ] **Large file optimization** - Optimize memory usage for large file transfers

## Low Priority Features

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **SFTP support** - Add SSH File Transfer Protocol support
- [ ] **GUI interface** - Create a graphical user interface
- [ ] **REST API** - Provide programmatic access to FTP client functionality
- [ ] **Plugin system** - Allow third-party extensions

### Development & Testing
- [ ] **Comprehensive integration tests** - Test against various FTP servers
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks** - Measure and optimize transfer speeds
- [ ] **Error scenario testing** - Test error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] **Documentation improvements** - Add more examples and usage guides

## Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Error handling standardization** - Consistent error handling patterns across modules
- [ ] **Logging improvements** - Better structured logging with different levels
- [ ] **Code documentation** - Complete inline documentation for all public APIs
- [ ] **Unit test coverage** - Increase test coverage to >90%

### Architecture
- [ ] **Async/await implementation** - Convert to async for better performance
- [ ] **Memory optimization** - Reduce memory usage for large operations
- [ ] **Configuration validation** - Validate all configuration parameters
- [ ] **Graceful shutdown** - Handle interrupts and cleanup properly

## Notes

- Features marked with **bold** are considered high-impact improvements
- Items should be moved to "In Progress" when work begins
- Completed items should be moved to a "Completed" section with completion date
- New features should be added to the appropriate priority section
